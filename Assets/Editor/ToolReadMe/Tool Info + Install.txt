Tile Grid Control Tool (Work in Progress)

Installation: 
	-Simply add both folders to the unity project assets
	-To open the tool window, navigate to the unity toolbar and select 'Window -> Custom Grid Tool'

Usage: 
	-Manipulate the 'Cols' and 'Rows' (int value) to determine grid dimensions

	-Size scalar value (float) will change the local scale of the basic tile in all dimensions, 
	  as well as adjust tile spacing to match new scale
		~ (Base tiles have a default size of (1,1,1) and a 2D box collider with dimensions 1x1)

	-Anchor position will determine the position of the grid parent empty. Grids are currently built
	  starting from the anchor point to the right (+x), and then rows are built downward (-y).

**Work in progress**

Currently the tool is used to simply create a grid. I am hoping to improve the tool to allow adjustments
to existing grid(s). I am also wanting to add random obstacle generation based on new tool values, such 
as number of rocks/trees. 

The basic prefabs for the tile grid are located and loaded from the 'Resources' folder. Base tiles currently
only highlight their area on mouseover and the anchor point is just an empty gameobject.
