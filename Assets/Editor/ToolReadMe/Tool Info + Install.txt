Tile Grid Control Tool (Work in Progress)

Installation (if grabbing tool separately): 

	-Simply add folders to the unity project assets

	-If installing over an older version, select to replace all duplicate files
		~A new grid will likely need to be created (if there is an existing one) as the grid 
		  anchor prefab has been modified to include a small script

Usage: 
	-To open the tool window, navigate to the unity toolbar and select 'Window -> Custom Grid Tool'

	-Manipulate the 'Cols' and 'Rows' (int value) to determine grid dimensions

	-Size scalar value (float) will change the local scale of the basic tile in all dimensions, 
	  as well as adjust tile spacing to match new scale
		~ (Base tiles have a default size of (1,1,1) and a 2D box collider with dimensions 1x1)

	-Anchor position will determine the position of the grid parent empty. Grids are currently built
	  starting from the anchor point to the right (+x), and then rows are built downward (-y).
	
	-Grid Name will be the new grid's anchor name (the name of the empty parent of the tile grid).
	
	-Create/Adjust Grid button creates new grid or adjusts the selected grid based on the tool 
	  dimensions entered
 
Disclaimers:

	-Grid management is based largely on TILE NAME. If renaming specific tiles is required, add custom name
	  AFTER the base tile name.
	
	-Currently there is no way to increase/decrease slider ranges and scalar range for grid options
	  (potential addition later in needed)

	-The tool WILL NOT FUNCTION properly if tiles are removed or added outside of the tool. A disclaimer
	  will show in the tool if this occurs and there will be no option to adjust the grid.

**This is a work in progress**

I am also wanting to add random obstacle generation based on new tool values, such 
as number of rocks/trees once progress is made toward adding those to the project. 

The basic prefabs for the tile grid are located and loaded from the 'Resources/TileGridPrefabs' folder. Base tiles currently
only highlight their area on mouseover and the grid anchor is just an empty gameobject with a small script
for (expected) grid data.
